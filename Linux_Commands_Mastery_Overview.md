## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Safety Reminders

### \u26a0\ufe0f Commands to Use with EXTREME Caution

```bash
# NEVER run these without understanding:
rm -rf /          # Deletes entire system
rm -rf /*         # Deletes everything in root
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda  # Wipes disk

# Always verify before running:
rm -rf directory/  # Check you're in right location
chmod -R 777       # Creates security vulnerabilities
chown -R           # Can break system if done to wrong directory
```

### \u2705 Safe Practices
1. Always use `ls` to verify before `rm`
2. Test commands with `--dry-run` when available
3. Backup before making system changes
4. Use `sudo` only when necessary
5. Read command output and error messages
6. Keep regular backups
